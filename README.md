This was the app I developed during my internship as an iOS developer at Our Wave Hub & Apple Canada. Throughout the program, I was tasked with thinking of a problem that matters to me and going through the entire design process to develop a solution for it through an app. Just before this internship, I had taken a road trip to the United States and being a vegetarian, I struggled a lot with finding food that fit my interests and dietary restrictions. With already existing applications like Google Maps and Apple Maps, I noticed many missing features that made their versions of a solution unreliable and difficult to use. After interviewing others who had come across the same problem, I set out to create my own solution. 

Using a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/18000-vegan-vegetarian-restaurants-in-the-us), I first organized the information I wanted to show and then created a program to draw several location pins on the map once someone inputted their address. Recognizing the address also required a separate program which increased the difficulty of this project. After these two things were done, I added a feature to click on one of the location pins, get to know that location, and then directs you to where it is compared to your current location.

In the future, the app will look to narrow these locations down using dietary restrictions provided by the user. It will also include a plan your trip feature to create trips you can look back at later and earn points for.
